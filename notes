Potential solution:

glue index to split characters in tuplet or string form - eg, 'hello' - > ['h0', 'e1', 'l2', 'l3', 'o4'] ( or tuplet form, [['h',0], ['e',1]...])

sort into two arrays, one with non-alphabet characters. 

apply casing to the alphabet array.

Join arrays and sort

rejoin characters
